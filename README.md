# semproelShare
A [Pure Plain-Javascript, Good-Looking, Customizable, Efficient, Lightweight, Fast] Social Share Plugin with Unified Count.

## Intro
There has been so many notable social share plugins written in javascript. What triggers me creating this is that I want a social share plugin that are independent (i.e. pure plain-javascript), modular, using Promise API, real-time (i.e. updatable share count after user click on share buttons), and having unified/centralized count.
