There has been so many notable social share plugins written in javascript. What triggers me creating this is that I want a social share plugin that is independent (i.e. pure plain-javascript), modular, using Promise API, real-time (i.e. updatable share count after user click on share buttons), and having unified/centralized count.

## Browser Support
As long as you polyfill javascript Promise, the modern browser support for both mobile and desktop (IE 9+) should be okay.
